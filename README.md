# Project Cash Management

## Client: Quera College

### Back-End Jump with Django 


# :pushpin: Introduction

Quera asked us to design and implement the backend part of a financial exchange site using Django.
In this design, we should be able to have exchanges within the network with the ability to accurately record the details of each transaction.

##  :dart:Goals

 1. The user must be able to create an account for himself.
 2.   Users should be able to create multiple credit accounts for their personal account.
 3. Users can make financial transactions within the network.
 4. Details of financial transactions must be accurately recorded.
 5. Transactions should be able to be edited at certain situations.
 6. Transactions must be atomic if canceled.
 7. The admin panel should be designed with the ability to accurately control data.


## :iphone: API

Two apps have been designed to satisfy all the goals, and each app has its own required APIs.
:bulb: For more information on how each API works, refer to the README.pdf.
